// Validating benchmarks:
Benchmarked method `DistanceSearchValueTypeInFloat` is static. Benchmarks MUST be instance methods, static methods are not supported.
Benchmarked method `DistanceSearchValueTypeInFloatSqrtless` is static. Benchmarks MUST be instance methods, static methods are not supported.
Benchmarked method `DistanceSearchValueTypeInDouble` is static. Benchmarks MUST be instance methods, static methods are not supported.
Benchmarked method `DistanceSearchValueTypeInDoubleSqrtless` is static. Benchmarks MUST be instance methods, static methods are not supported.
Benchmarked method `DistanceSearchRefTypeInFloat` is static. Benchmarks MUST be instance methods, static methods are not supported.
Benchmarked method `DistanceSearchRefTypeInFloatSqrtless` is static. Benchmarks MUST be instance methods, static methods are not supported.
Benchmarked method `DistanceSearchRefTypeInDouble` is static. Benchmarks MUST be instance methods, static methods are not supported.
Benchmarked method `DistanceSearchRefTypeInDoubleSqrtless` is static. Benchmarks MUST be instance methods, static methods are not supported.
Assembly Algorithms which defines benchmarks is non-optimized
Benchmark was built without optimization enabled (most probably a DEBUG configuration). Please, build it in RELEASE.
If you want to debug the benchmarks, please see https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/guides/troubleshooting.html#debugging-benchmarks.
